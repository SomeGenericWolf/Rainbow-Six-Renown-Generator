Hello stranger!
Thank you for downloading this script!

==================================================================================

Do not delete the "Files" folder, the program works with image recognition and 
needs those samples in able to work

==================================================================================

Before running the "RenownGenerator.exe", you'll have to change some in-game
settings in order for the program to work. 
Check the "Instructions" folder to get more info.

==================================================================================

The game has to be 100% visible on the screen while the script is running, 
otherwise, it won't work properly.

==================================================================================

Once the game is visible, let the computer do the rest.
You can go to sleep or something, I don't know.

==================================================================================

To stop it, just press CTR+C in the console, or "Esc" while in a match, and then 
wait a few seconds, the command prompt window will let you know when your 
configuration file is back to normal and then it will close itself automatically.
